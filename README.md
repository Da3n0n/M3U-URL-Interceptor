first of all you can achieve what this extension achives by  opening Devtools (f12) > go to Network activity > search m3u > snipe the first GET Reqeuest M3U URL from the list of results . 

so why make this ? because you cant copy and paste or select the url form devtools inisde VR on Virtual Desktop , so this has been made so you can easily switch links within Virtual Desktop inside VR , instead of the process dev tool > network > search > Copy  etc jsut open extension and click button :)
